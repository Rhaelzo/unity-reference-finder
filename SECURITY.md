## Reporting a Vulnerability

Due to the nature of the project, it shouldn't compromise the user or the project, but if you find any vulnerability 
please report it as an issue so I can look into it. Templates exist for this already, so use them and follow
the instructions. If anything comes up, please contact me.

(Suggestions for fixes are very much welcome, and I'll look into them and create assist in the PR creation if necessary)
